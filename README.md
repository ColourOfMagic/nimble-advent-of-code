# Advent of Code `nimble`

*This is the first code that I wrote to solve the puzzle and I don't think it's the fastest or optimal solution, but it can be!*

Just implement `Day` and `DayTest` to pass the task.
The junit test, when started, runs all variants sequentially:
1. First test
2. First answer
3. Second test
4. Second answer

Or start manually via `main()`
